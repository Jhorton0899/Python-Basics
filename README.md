# Python-Basics
this is just the basics of python, good read if your just getting started tried my best to break it down line by line, please additionnal input and advice is of course appreciated. I've been working with python for the last 3 years specifically with data so most of my time is spent with pandas and seaborn but the basics are always good to start with as theyre the fundementals for everything else that we do. I'll try to keep adding to this repositorty as much as i can progressively working from smaller projects to larger.
